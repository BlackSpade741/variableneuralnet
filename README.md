# variableneuralnet
A Neural Network Package based largely on the binaryneuralnet (@https://github.com/reecemartin/binaryneuralnet) but, with custom numbers of input and output as well as hidden layers. This means users will be able to create feed-forward networks with varying structures allowing for significantly more possible applications.

#Acknowlegements:

As with the binaryneuralnet (@https://github.com/reecemartin/binaryneuralnet) project, this project is largely inspired by and based on information and techniques from Jeff Heaton's videos and lectures on Neural Networks posted on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/user/HeatonResearch

We also would like to acknowlege Ray Kurzweil's excellent book "How to Create a Mind" which provided inspiration for this project as well as a broad overview on Machine Learning. (Amazon Link: https://www.amazon.ca/How-Create-Mind-Thought-Revealed/dp/0143124048)

For more technical details, filling in gaps, and expanding on information from the previously mentioned lectures and videos we utilized Wikipedias excellent in-depth pages on Backpropagation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation), Perceptrons (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron), Multi-Layer Perceptrons (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron), Activation Functions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function), the Logistic Curve (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function), and Gradient Descent (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent).
